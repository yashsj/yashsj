## 🚀 About Me

I'm passionate about backend systems, data engineering, and leveraging AI for smarter solutions.  
Recent work includes using OpenAI embeddings and vector databases to speed up debugging and lookup times for complex platforms. I love automating processes, building semantic AI apps, and making search & analytics systems more useful for real people. When not coding, I enjoy coffee, hiking, and sharing knowledge with developer communities.
